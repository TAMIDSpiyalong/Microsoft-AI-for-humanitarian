This repo is based on the paper below using only Tweet text as input to estimate the winter storm Uri average damage in 7 FEMA categories. Due to the big file sizes, download the missing csv files here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MnDcO6G4Rni2wgnmsJel16uGM68hA9j4). You need TAMU email address to access. These files are prepared specificly for the winter storm application.
